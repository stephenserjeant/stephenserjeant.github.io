I'm the Open University's Professor of Astronomy specialising in extragalactic surveys of star-forming galaxies and strong gravitational lensing. I've written or co-written over 300 papers so far with over 10,000 citations in all, and four books, and co-won a 2004 [Daiwa Adrian Prize](http://www.dajf.org.uk/) for Anglo-Japanese scientific collaboration. I'm also a [Fellow of the Institute of Physics](http://www.iop.org), a [Fellow of the Higher Education Academy](http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/), a [Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society](http://www.ras.org.uk/) and a [Chartered Physicist](http://www.iop.org/membership/chartered/chartered_titles/cphys/page_38079.html), meaning that I have three F-words and one C-word after my name, all well deserved.

I wrote a [paper](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012arXiv1202.1829F) with George Djorgovski, who wrote a [paper](http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1105714166) with Jogesh Babu, who wrote a [paper](http://books.google.com/books?id=nw9ujImV3pwC&pg=PA441&lpg=PA441&dq=%22a+note+on+the+distribution+function+of+additive+arithmetical+functions+in+short+intervals%22&source=web&ots=cG7d9CnrRD&sig=7unLOf4nqfbY2HFlyEvf5vpCUyo) with Paul Erdös, giving me an [Erdös number](http://www.oakland.edu/enp) of no more than three, or exactly three assuming [this list](https://files.oakland.edu/users/grossman/enp/Erdos2.html) is currently complete. This is five less than [Erwin Schrödinger](http://www.oakland.edu/enp/erdpaths). There's a lesson in there somewhere but for some reason I don't feel it's in my best interests to point it out.
